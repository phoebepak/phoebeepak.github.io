        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Phoebe Pak and I am a first year student at the University of California, Riverside currently studying psychology. I am originally from Milpitas in the Bay Area.<br><br>

        In my free time I enjoy journaling and listening to music. I often create new playlists based on my mood that specific week. I also enjoy going to the gym and staying consistently active. I also like watching movies and shows, and am often searching for new genres to watch. Although I am open to any genre, I usually enjoy shows with dystopian or thrilling aspects to it. I also recently started to read more and am currently reading a fantasy/dystopian series. I have also been going outside more often to try and connect with nature which led me to start taking pictures on my camera. I have also been fixated on fashion recently, so I have been looking into new apparel brands.<br><br>

        Throughout my time in highschool I volunteered for numerous organizations, the main ones being FHIH and Dasom Korean School. FHIH is a non-profit organization aiming to better the lives of people with neurological disorders. My role within FHIH was to not only hang out with kids and adults with these disorders, but to also teach them basic knowledge that will help them in life. At Dasom Korean School, I was a TA that not only assisted the teacher, but also taught the classes myself for certain occasions. I earned numerous awards for my volunteer work, such as the PVSA and the NAKS junior leadership award. At both volunteer positions I received scholarship awards as well. I also worked as a swim instructor and lifeguard at two different locations, both sports centers, throughout high school. Through these experiences, I gained new skills and leadership opportunities which allowed me to become the person I am today. I have also been involved in sports since I was a kid. I have been swimming since 1st grade and began playing water polo my freshman year of high school. I was the team captain for our water polo team and played as a varsity player for three years. Being in a team sport has taught me the importance of teamwork and communication. I learned to be more patient and understanding of others and myself. I am an organized and dedicated person whether it is towards academics or social aspects. I take my work very seriously and make sure everything is completed in a timely manner. I strive to work efficiently and quickly, making sure I put enough effort into my work. I am persevering and strive to always be a better version of myself. I am fluent in both Korean and English as my first language was Korean. I am also a good listener and will communicate well with others, which is why I decided to pursue a major in Psychology. After graduating from UCR, I plan to apply to medical school after taking a gap year, so I can later become a Pediatric Psychiatrist.
